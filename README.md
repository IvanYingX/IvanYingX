Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Iván, and I am a Senior Full Stack Engineer with a background in Process and Chemical Engineering (PhD, Imperial College London). While my academic roots are in engineering, my passion for coding and problem-solving led me to transition into software development and data science. I specialize in full stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud-based applications.

Currently, I work as a Full Stack Engineer at AiCore, where I design and implement scalable React, Node.js, and AWS-based applications for an AI and data science education platform. I take ownership of features end-to-end, from backend architecture to frontend performance optimization. My work also involves integrating engagement tools and mentoring aspiring engineers, which aligns with my passion for education and technology.<br>

My Key Skills:<br>

🚀 Full Stack Development (TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda)<br>
🐍 Python & AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Data Pipelines)<br>
🔧 Cloud & DevOps (AWS, CI/CD, Serverless Architectures)<br>
📊 Data Science & Analytics (Machine Learning, Process Optimization)<br>

This GitHub serves as a collection of personal projects, full stack applications, and AI experiments, reflecting my continuous learning and exploration in software engineering and data science.<br>
